As the volume of email grows, organizing and finding relevant email remains challenging. In this paper, we present a large-scale log analysis of the activities that people perform on email mes-sages (accessing external information via links or attachments, responding to messages, and organizing messages), their search behavior, and their organizational practices in a popular web email client. First, we characterize general email activities as well as activities associated with search. We find that within search sessions, peo-ple are more likely to access information and respond to messag-es but less likely to organize. Second, we examine the relation-ship between characteristics of a person's mailbox and their search and organizational practices. People with larger mailboxes tend to organize more, respond a little more, and access infor-mation less. People with larger mailboxes and folder structures search more, but the number of folders has less influence on search. Third, we extend previous work on email organization (e.g., filers vs. pilers; cleaners vs. keepers) by examining the extent to which these strategies are evident in our large-scale analysis and influence email activities and search. People who rely heavily on one organizational strategy tend to use others less. People who organize less tend to search more. Finally, we de-scribe how these insights can influence the design of email search.","tags":null,"title":"Large-scale analysis of email search and organizational strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samleo L Joseph","Jizhong Xiao","Xiaochen Zhang","Bhupesh Chawda","Kanika Narang","Nitendra Rajput","Sameep Mehta","L Venkata Subramaniam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1421193600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1421193600,"objectID":"048485ee4c8db5b2040121aa71ed858d","permalink":"https://kanika91.github.io/publication/ths15/","publishdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ths15/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper lays the ground work for assistive navigation using wearable sensors and social sensors to foster situational awareness for the blind. Our system acquires social media messages to gauge the relevant aspects of an event and to create alerts. We propose social semantics that captures the parameters required for querying and reasoning an event-of-interest, such as what, where, who, when, severity, and action from the Internet of things, using an event summarization algorithm. Our approach integrates wearable sensors in the physical world to estimate user location based on metric and landmark localization. Streaming data from the cyber world are employed to provide awareness by summarizing the events around the user based on the situation awareness factor. It is illustrated using disaster and socialization event scenarios. Discovered local events are fed back using sound localization so that the user can actively participate in a social event or get early warning of any hazardous events. A feasibility evaluation of our proposed algorithm included comparing the output of the algorithm to ground truth, a survey with sighted participants about the algorithm output, and a sound localization user interface study with blind-folded sighted participants. Thus, our framework supports the navigation problem for the blind by combining the advantages of our real-time localization technologies so that the user is being made aware of the world, a necessity for independent travel.","tags":null,"title":"Being aware of the world: Toward using social media to support the blind with navigation.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samleo L Joseph","Jizhong Xiao","Bhupesh Chawda","Kanika Narang","Padmashri Janarthanam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1401840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1401840000,"objectID":"2bb82c2c6b9490fcaade4881d50d69fa","permalink":"https://kanika91.github.io/publication/cyber14/","publishdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cyber14/","section":"publication","summary":"This article presents a novel approach of utilizing the Internet of things (IoT) to create situational awareness to the blind user.

Social microblog sites like Twitter have become favorite portals for users to discuss and express opinions on events and topics. Established event detection techniques on microblog streams today are capable of detecting events early in their lifecycle, amidst the volumes of user message exchanges. Techniques have been proposed in literature to identify topical conversations on microblogging portals comprising of unstructured data with no explicit discussion thread, distinguishing such conversations from isolated expressions of topical interests. However, evolutions of discussion topics have not been studied in a geographical context before. In the current work, we identify and characterize topical discussions at different geographical granularities, such as countries and cities. We observe geographical localization of evolution of topical discussions. Experimental results suggest that these discussion threads tend to evolve more strongly over geographically finer granularities: they evolve more at city levels compared to country levels, and more at country levels compared to globally. Our algorithm to find geographical evolution of discussion sequences and the derived insights can be used for information spread analyses and related applications on microblogging networks.","tags":null,"title":"Topical discussions on unstructured microblogs: analysis from a geographical perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanika Narang","Seema Nagar","Sameep Mehta","L Venkata Subramaniam","Kuntal Dey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"3715d68685881a628703d19e335d4d0e","permalink":"https://kanika91.github.io/publication/ijcnlp13/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcnlp13/","section":"publication","summary":"Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have become favorite portals for users to discuss and express opinions. Research shows that topical discussions around events tend to evolve socially on microblogs. However, sources like Twitter have no explicit discussion thread which will link semantically similar posts. Moreover, the discussion may be evolving in multiple different threads (like Facebook). Researchers have proposed the use of online contemporary documents to act as external corpus to connect pairs of contextually related semantic topics. This motivates the question: given a significant social event, what is a good choice of external corpus to identify evolution of discussion topics around the event’s context? In this work, we compare the effectiveness of contemporary blog posts, online news media and forum discussions in creating adhoc external corpus. Using social propensity of evolution of topical discussions on Twitter to assess the goodness of the creation, we find online news media as most effective. We evaluate on three large real life Twitter datasets to affirm our findings.","tags":null,"title":"An Empirical Assessment of Contemporary Online Media in Ad-Hoc Corpus Creation for Social Events.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanika Narang","Kristina Lerman","Ponnurangam Kumaraguru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1376179200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1376179200,"objectID":"2982040a421be2b37adf98031176e8f9","permalink":"https://kanika91.github.io/publication/kdd13/","publishdate":"2013-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd13/","section":"publication","summary":"Link prediction is used by many applications to recommend new products or social connections to people.

Online social conversations can be used to retrieve users interests towards given topics and trends. Microblogging platforms like Twitter are primary examples of social networks with significant volumes of topical message exchanges between users. However, unlike traditional online discussion forums, blogs and social networking sites, explicit discussion threads are absent from microblogging networks like Twitter. This inherent absence of any conversation framework makes it challenging to distinguish conversations from mere topical interests. In this work, we explore semantic, social and temporal relationships of topical clusters formed in Twitter to identify conversations. We devise an algorithm comprising of a sequence of steps such as text clustering, topical similarity detection using TF-IDF and Wordnet, and intersecting social, semantic and temporal graphs to discover social conversations around topics. We further qualitatively show the presence of social localization of discussion threads. Our results suggest that discussion threads evolve significantly over social networks on Twitter.
